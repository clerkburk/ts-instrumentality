## The INSTRUMENTALITY project
A utility library for TypeScript/Node.js


#
### What is this?
A combination of files to handle TS/JS by itself, Node and DOM (for web) that provides functions, classes and whatnot to reduce boilerplate for common operations.


#
### How to use
```sh
npm install git+https://github.com/clerkburk/ts-instrumentality.git
```
then
```ts
import * as isb from "ts-instrumentality" // Base
import * as isn from "ts-instrumentality/dom" // Browser (if available)
import * as isd from "ts-instrumentality/road" // Filesystem using Node.js (if available)
import * as isf from "ts-instrumentality/serv" // HTTP2 Server using Node.js (if available)
```
thats literally it
